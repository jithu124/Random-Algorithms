/*Static data member
    -is associated with class not with object
    -is shared by all the objects of a class
    -needs to be defined outside the class scope (in addition to the declaration within the class scope) to avoid linker error
    -must be initialized in a source file
    -is constructed before main() starts and destructed after main() ends
    -can be private / public type
    -can be accessed with 
        *the class-name followed by the scope resolution operator (::)
        *as a member of any object of the class
    -virtually eliminates any need for global variables in OOPs environment*/

/*static member function
does not have this pointer â€“ not associated with any object
cannot access non-static data members
cannot invoke non-static member functions
can be accessed
*with the class-name followed by the scope resolution operator (::)
*as a member of any object of the class
is needed to read / write static data members
*Again, for encapsulation static data members should be private
*get()-set() idiom is built for access (static member functions in public)
may initialize static data members even before any object creation
cannot co-exist with a non-static version of the same function
cannot be declared as const*/
